# About Project
- ## The Problem
    The core elements of the CC Legal Tools consist of three vital components: the legal code itself, the accompanying deed that offers a description in simplified language, and the underlying machine-readable layer. Unfortunately, the machine-readable layer has not undergone substantial updates in recent times, leading to unresolved problems and the use of outdated technology. Moreover, regrettably, the CC Legal Tools have simply copied the legacy RDF/XML without making necessary improvements.

- ## Primary Goals of the Project 

    To address the above issues, the solution involves extending the CC Legal Tools App's functionality to generate deterministic RDF/XML files for each CC tool and license.

    - ### Benefits After The Project Completetion 

        **Enhanced Structure and Consistency:** 
        - The new RDF/XML format introduces a meticulously organized and standardized structure, adhering to RDF standards.
        - This elevated structure improves machine comprehension, enabling precise data processing and interpretation.
        
        
        **Robust License Information:** 
        - License information has undergone comprehensive updates to mirror the latest permissions and constraints accurately.
        - This meticulous revision ensures that users and systems are provided with up-to-date and reliable insights.
        
        
        **Alignment with RDF Best Practices:** 
        - The introduced changes align the representation seamlessly with established RDF best practices.
        - By incorporating standardized namespaces, maintaining consistent nomenclature, and accurately defining relationships, enhanced interoperability and compatibility are fostered.
        

    ## Overall Impact
    This project not only resolves existing issues but also modernizes the CC legal tools, making them more accessible, reliable, and user-friendly. This aligns with the broader goal of facilitating the sharing and use of creative works while maintaining legal clarity.
